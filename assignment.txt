Explanation:
read_and_modify_file function:

Opens the input file (input_filename) in read mode and reads its content.

Modifies the content (in this case, converting the text to uppercase).

Writes the modified content to the output file (output_filename).

Error handling is in place to catch:

FileNotFoundError if the input file doesnâ€™t exist.

IOError if there is an issue reading or writing the file.

A generic Exception if any other unforeseen error occurs.

main function:

Prompts the user for the filenames.

Calls the read_and_modify_file function to handle the file operations.

Error Handling:
The program handles errors gracefully by catching exceptions such as FileNotFoundError and IOError and printing appropriate error messages.
